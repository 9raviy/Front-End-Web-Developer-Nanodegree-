## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

##Functionalities

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
The project uses javascript to dynamically create a navbar for all the sections present in the html document

##Section Active State
While scrolling through the page, the section currently in the viewport automatically gets highlighted. It is achieved using addEventListener function in javascript.

##When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
It is achieved by dynamically adding an 'href' attribute to every nav link list item. An event listener is used to listen to a click and scrollIntoView function is used for achieving a smooth scroll to the desired element.

##Learnings
It has been quite a challenging project as the functions used in the project were not taught in the curriculum. But in retrospect is teaches a critical skill of searching for solutions online for a challenging problem, understanding it enough to customise it for building our own solution. Agreed one cannot learn all but should be skilled in finding the answers and using them effectively.
